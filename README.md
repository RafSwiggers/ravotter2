# Final HTML Test: Ravotter

## Summary and goals
The objective of this project is to, as a group, think of a new company and provide a website for it. Fully functional and designed with all the relevant tests in mind, this website is to be a finished project. Completely applicable. The underlying idea is to become familiar with working on a project with many requirements, as a group. Detail-oriented and efficient, working from scratch.

## Publishing
We're working on Github for several reasons. It is easy to work together, storage is cloud-based and the coaches can evaluate us as we work. It's also a great way to present the final work in our portfolio

## Site Design choices

### Main design
We chose a simple, but effective design of a white page scrolling over parallax headers, with a Nav-bar on top. The red and yellow color-scheme is aimed at a fun, cheerful atmosphere. The header images are meant to indicate a place that is fit for kids, fun and professional. Our main point of reference would be the indoor playground:

### Nav bar
The nav bar is completely opaque when at the top, turning into a sticky navigation bar fitting the theme as soon as the user scrolls down. It does not affect the main landing, but does become a useful, ever-present tool when scrolling down. As such, it is non-disruptive without losing function.

When the screen gets smaller, the nav-bar folds, showing a hamburger icon to indicate the drop-down possibilities.

### Parallax
The headers are images fitting the content of the page and highlighting the atmosphere. they are full-width and scroll under the page content, bringing the content into focus. It also makes the content fresh and clean.

### Form
A simple, responsive form allowing potential customers to ask us any questions regarding their child's safety and comfort during their stay with us.

### Activities
A playful look at what we offer the children with regard to activites, using the ball-formed pictures to reference the always popular ball-pit.

### Menu
A simple presentation of the local menu, in keeping with the colors of the website.

### Info
We added both the address and a Google map, for ease of use. We also added opening hours and an email for, as well as a phone number on which to reach us.

### Design
We chose a simple design, keeping the content centered. The pages feature a parallax header with a page title.
